# Artifact of the Unchained
This artifact lets you configure how much of a nerf to damage/proc coefficients you want proc chains, procs from items (fireworks, shurikens, etc) and/or procs from equipments to get.

These are the default settings:
- Procs spawned from equipments will deal 20% of their normal damage
- Procs spawned from other procs (via proc-chaining) will deal 10% of their normal damage
- Procs spawned from any other items will deal 20% of their normal damage
- Procs can chain into your other on-hit procs only once.
- All settings can be configured in-game using [Risk of Options](https://thunderstore.io/package/Rune580/Risk_Of_Options/)
