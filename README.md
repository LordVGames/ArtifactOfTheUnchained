# Artifact of the Unchained
This artifact lets you configure how much of a nerf you want proc chains and procs from items (fireworks, shurikens, etc) to get. These are the default settings:
- All equipments and items that can proc items for you can chain into your on-hit items only once.
- Those chained procs will have their damage reduced to 20% of what they would normally do.
Monster procs aren't as supported by the artifact as player procs are, but I did my best to make it work similarly.
